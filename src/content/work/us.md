I work on cutting-edge research projects in two main areas: prescriptive process monitoring and quantum software engineering. In prescriptive process monitoring, I leverage deep learning techniques to develop advanced monitoring systems. In quantum software engineering, I explore the application of quantum computing principles, aiming to pioneer new methodologies and tools that harness the power of quantum technology.

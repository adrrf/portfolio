As a software engineer, I’ve allways been fascinated by the frontiers of technology, constantly seeking to understand and explore the cutting edge. This relentless curiosity has often led me down many late-night researching sprees. One night, I found myself fully immersed in papers, web articles, and videos discussing quantum computing—the new frontier of computation.

Quantum computing promises to revolutionize how we solve a subset of problems by offering exponential speedups for certain types of problems compared to classical computers. As I went deeper in the field, I realized that much of the discourse around quantum computing was dominated by mathematicians and physicists.

This realization was disappointing to me, as I believe that, as a form of computation, software engineers need to have these tools and understand their implications. Our role in designing and building practical applications is crucial for bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world implementations.

One day at university, a professor reached out to the students and asked if anyone liked math and quantum computing. It was the first time I heard someone at the university actively promoting interest in this field. This professor’s passion and encouragement sparked my own interest even further, making me realize the potential impact we could have as a software engineers in the realm of quantum computing.

This idea in my mind led me to write my Bachelor’s thesis on quantum computing and, ultimately, to the decision to create my own quantum computing simulator.

In this blog, I will document the journey of developing Qitty, sharing the steps, challenges and triumphs along the way. Whether you’re a fellow enthusiast, a seasoned professional, or just curious about quantum computing, I hope you’ll find something of value here.
